During the deployment, you received complaints from users that the website was responding with errors. All instances passed the ELB health checks. What should you do in order to avoid errors for future deployments? (Choose 2 answer) [PROFESSIONAL]",

      "A. Add an Elastic Load Balancing health check to the Auto Scaling group. Set a short period for the health checks to operate as soon as possible in order to prevent premature registration of the instance to the load balancer.",

Double the size of the group, wait for the new instances to become healthy, and reduce back to the original size.
