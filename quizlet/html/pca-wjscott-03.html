You may test them, but you cannot control them. If you have doubts the third-party dependencies causing the overall performance issue, you may use integration test to identify and isolate them. This should not be your focus. <br><br>B (Correct answer) - Instrument the load-testing tool and the target services with detailed logging and metrics collection. <br><br>This is normal requirement and practice for load testing to collect testing results with detailed measurable metric and historical logs otherwise load testing would be meaningless <br><br>C (Correct answer) - Create a separate Google Cloud project to use for the load-testing environment. <br><br>This is a good practice for least privileges and separation of responsibilities. <br><br>D - Instrument the production services to record every transaction for replay by the load- testing tool. <br><br>This would be way too much: not only the detailed instrumentation may impact the production performance, it's also possible the instrumentation itself distorts the test results - remember, Bigtable is for multiple terabyte or even petabyte NoSQL database for high throughput with low latency read and write. <br><br>E (Correct answer) - Ensure that the load tests validate the performance of Cloud Bigtable. <br><br>At first thought, it seems Bigtable is managed service seamlessly scaling, there is no need to load test it.

Shared VPC allows each team to individually manage their own application resources, while enabling each application to communicate between each other securely over RFC1918 address space. <br><br>In this example, you'll create one Host project for Developer and Tester and another Host project for staging and production <br><br>B - This is incomplete or nor a best solution. Network isolation is for separation of resources communication, project is for IAM resource access control. <br><br>If the question meant putting resources in different networks but in same project, it's not enough to separate developer from access Stage/Product unless access policy is set at each specific resource level which is not only against the best practice but also hard to manage especially if you consider Mountkirk Games is not a small shop. <br><br>Answer C is incorrect for same or similar reasons. <br><br>Answer D indeed enables the isolation but also disables the sharing since Dev and Test need to access each other's environments and resources and Stage need some access to Production <br><br>On the other hand, if the quest meant Developer and tester are in same group called Development (based on &quot;What should you do to isolate development environments from staging and production?&quot;), D could be an answer since it isolates the development from staging and production, though no inter-project access issues addressed. <br><br>Overall, judging from Mountkirk Games application, environments, and company size, most likely they'll have separated Development and Testing while they do share access some resources such as access testing data as well as computing resources.

You should use different account for each environment which associated with different group of users. You should use project to isolate user access to resource not to manage users. <br>• Using a shared VPC allows each team to individually manage their own application resources, while enabling each application to communicate between each other securely over RFC1918 address space.

The network is global in scope and spans all cloud regions. <br><br>In a legacy network, instance IP addresses are not grouped by region or zone. One IP address can appear in one region, and the following IP address can be in a different region. Any given range of IPs can be spread across all regions, and the IP addresses of instances created within a region are not necessarily contiguous. <br><br>It is not possible to create regional subnets with a legacy network. <br><br>legacy networking Example: <br>[URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/whizlabs-pub/GCP+Professional+Cloud+Architect+Images/GCP+PCA_PT2/PT2_Q47.png ]<br><br>Subnets and IP ranges <br>Each VPC network consists of one or more useful IP range partitions called subnetworks or subnets. Each subnet is associated with a region. Networks can contain one or more subnets in any given region. Subnets are regional resources. <br><br>Each subnet must have a primary address range, which is a valid RFC 1918 CIDR block. <br><br>Subnets in the same network must use unique IP ranges. Subnets in different networks, even in the same project, can re-use the same IP address ranges. <br><br>VPC network example: <br>[URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/whizlabs-pub/GCP+Professional+Cloud+Architect+Images/GCP+PCA_PT2/PT2_Q47.1.png ]<br><br>subnet3 is defined as 10.2.0.0/16, in the us-east1 region.

As part of Google Cloud's stream analytics solution, the service ingests event streams and delivers them to Cloud Dataflow for processing and BigQuery for analysis as a data warehousing solution. Relying on the Cloud Pub/Sub service for delivery of event data frees you to focus on transforming your business and data systems with applications such as: <br><br>• check Real-time personalization in gaming<br>• check Fast reporting, targeting and optimization in advertising and media<br>• check Processing device data for healthcare, manufacturing, oil and gas, and logistics<br>• check Syndicating market-related data streams for financial services<br><br>Other solutions may work one way or other but only the combination of theses 3 components integrate well in data ingestion, collection, and real-time analysis, and data mining in a highly durable, elastic, and parallel manner. <br><br>A - Cloud storage is not suitable for this kind of real-time streaming data collection; Dataproc is GCP's BigData Hadoop/Spark that can do ETL and analysis, but DataFlow provide simple unified programming model for ETL and analysis in bot Realtime and batch and integrate well with PubSub. <br><br>C - Cloud SQL is mainly for OLTP (Transactional, CRUD) not for OLAP (On-line Analytical Processing, Data Warehouse). It does not have the scalability, elasticity, and parallel to absorb this amount of Data in real time. Instead BigQuery integrate well with DataFlow and can absorb both steaming and batch data from it. <br><br>D - Bigtable is one of the possible Data sink for DataFlow and have the capability to absorb this amount of real time data but it lacks the Data mining features like BigQuery. <br><br>Further Explanation<br>Pub/Sub is kind of 'shock absorber', allowing asynchronous messaging between large numbers of devices.

There are many reasons this could happen, from a full disk to an accidental misconfiguration of sshd. This section describes a number of tips and approaches to troubleshoot and resolve common SSH issues. \n\n1) Check your firewall rules\nGoogle Compute Engine provisions each project with a default set of firewall rules which permit SSH traffic. If the default firewall rule that permits SSH connections is somehow removed, you'll be unable to access your instance. Check your list of firewalls with the gcloud compute command-line tool and ensure the default-allow-ssh rule is present. \n\ngcloud compute firewall-rules list\n\nIf the firewall rule is missing, add it back: \n\ngcloud compute firewall-rules create default-allow-ssh --allow tcp:22\n\n2) Debug the issue in the serial console\n\nYou can enable read-write access to an instance's serial console so you can log into the console and troubleshoot problems with the instance. This is particularly useful when you cannot log in with SSH or if the instance has no connection to the network. The serial console remains accessible in both these conditions. \n3) Test the network ... ... ...\n4) Try a new user ... ... ...\n5) Use your disk on a new instance ... ... ...\n\n6) Inspect an instance without shutting it down\nYou might have an instance you can't connect to that continues to correctly serve production traffic. In this case, you might want to inspect the disk without interrupting the instance's ability to serve users. First, take a snapshot of the instance's boot disk, then create a new disk from that snapshot, create a temporary instance, and finally attach and mount the new persistent disk to your temporary instance to troubleshoot the disk. 7) Use a startup script ...","_definitionTtsUrl":null,"_definitionSlowTtsUrl":null,"_definitionAudioUrl":null,"_imageUrl":null,"setId":350025933,"rank":24,"lastModified":1544495818,"wordCustomAudioId":null,"definitionCustomAudioId":null,"definitionImageId":null},"12006617938":{"id":12006617938,"word":"The security team has disabled external SSH access into production virtual machines in GCP.

Both run the ETL process to retrieve the data from each bucket, an appropriate way for the overall process. \n\nThe difference is where to which Cloud Storage location to use: regional or multi-regional. \n\nSince the vehicles are spread all over the world and since later retrieving (consumed) data is from centralized location, saving data to nearest regional bucket (instead of multi-reginal bucket in a large geographic area) and retrieve from there is better solution to \"minimize data transfer time on the cellular connections\". \n\nUse a multi-regional location when you want to serve content to data consumers that are outside of the Google network and distributed across large geographic areas. \nSo, answer B is correct.","_definitionTtsUrl":null,"_definitionSlowTtsUrl":null,"_definitionAudioUrl":null,"_imageUrl":null,"setId":350025933,"rank":37,"lastModified":1544496071,"wordCustomAudioId":null,"definitionCustomAudioId":null,"definitionImageId":null},"12015469299":{"id":12015469299,"word":"What is the best practice for separating responsibilities and access for production and development environments? \n\n [ ] Separate project for each environment, each team only has access to their project. \n [ ] Separate project for each environment, both teams have access to both projects. \n [ ] Both environments use the same project, but different VPC's. \n [ ] Both environments use the same project, just note which resources are in use by which group.","_wordTtsUrl":null,"_wordSlowTtsUrl":null,"_wordAudioUrl":null,"definition":"Correct Answer A \n\nExplanation \n\nA (Correct answer) - Separate project for each environment, each team only has access to their project. \n\nFor least privilege and separation of duties, the best practice is to separate both environments into different projects, development or production team gets their own accounts, and each team is assigned to only their projects. \n\nThe best practices: \n\u2022 You should not use same account for both Development and production environments regardless how do you create projects inside that account for different environments. You should use different account for each environment which associated with different group of users. You should use project to isolate user access to resource not to manage users. \n\u2022 Using a shared VPC allows each team to individually manage their own application resources, while enabling each application to communicate between each other securely over RFC1918 address space. So VPC's isolate resources but not user\/service accounts. \n\nB, C, and D are incorrect \n\nAnswer B is the scenario that use same account for both development and production environments attempting to isolate user access with different projects \n\nAnswer C is the scenario that use same account for both development and production environments with same project attempting to isolate user access with network separation. \n\nAnswer D is the scenario that use same account for both development and production environments with same project attempting to isolate user access with user group at resource level. \n\nYou may grant roles to group of users to set policies at organization level, project level, or (in some cases) the resource (e.g., existing Cloud Storage and BigQuery ACL systems as well as and Pub\/Sub topics) level. \n\nThe best practice: Set policies at the Organization level and at the Project level rather than at the resource level. This is because as new resources get added, you may want them to automatically inherit policies from their parent resource. For example, as new Virtual Machines gets added to the project through auto scaling, they automatically inherit the policy on the project. https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/docs\/resource-hierarchy-access-control#best_practices \n\nAdditional Resources: \n\nTo recap: IAM lets you control who (users) has what access (roles) to which resources by setting IAM policies.

As part of Google Cloud's stream analytics solution, the service ingests event streams and delivers them to Cloud Dataflow for processing and BigQuery for analysis as a data warehousing solution. Relying on the Cloud Pub\/Sub service for delivery of event data frees you to focus on transforming your business and data systems with applications such as: \n\n\u2022 check Real-time personalization in gaming\n\u2022 check Fast reporting, targeting and optimization in advertising and media\n\u2022 check Processing device data for healthcare, manufacturing, oil and gas, and logistics\n\u2022 check Syndicating market-related data streams for financial services\n\nOther solutions may work one way or other but only the combination of theses 3 components integrate well in data ingestion, collection, and real-time analysis, and data mining in a highly durable, elastic, and parallel manner. \n\nA - Cloud storage is not suitable for this kind of real-time streaming data collection; Dataproc is GCP's BigData Hadoop\/Spark that can do ETL and analysis, but DataFlow provide simple unified programming model for ETL and analysis in bot Realtime and batch and integrate well with PubSub. \n\nC - Cloud SQL is mainly for OLTP (Transactional, CRUD) not for OLAP (On-line Analytical Processing, Data Warehouse). It does not have the scalability, elasticity, and parallel to absorb this amount of Data in real time. Instead BigQuery integrate well with DataFlow and can absorb both steaming and batch data from it. \n\nD - Bigtable is one of the possible Data sink for DataFlow and have the capability to absorb this amount of real time data but it lacks the Data mining features like BigQuery. \n\nFurther Explanation\nPub\/Sub is kind of 'shock absorber', allowing asynchronous messaging between large numbers of devices. Cloud Dataflow acts as your data processing pipeline for ETL functions on both streaming and batch data. BigQuery is a data warehouse, able to run analysis on petabytes of data using SQL queries. \n\nBelow is a reference architect Google recommending for similar scenario in Real-time streaming data
