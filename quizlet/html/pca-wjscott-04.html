Also, this choice alone does not make complete answers to the question. <br><br>E (Correct Answer) - Total visits and average latency for users in Asia: Total visits can reflect and be a measure of the growing in Asia market by comparing to the number prior to the expanding; average latency for users in Asia is good measure and directly map to the technical requirements: Decrease latency in Asia. <br><br>JencoMart case study's Business and Technical Requirements, relevant to expanding to Asia are highlighted<br>Business Requirements<br>• Optimize for capacity during peak periods and value during off-peak periods. <br>• Guarantee service availability and support. <br>• Reduce on-premises footprint and associated financial and environmental impact. <br>• Move to outsourcing model to avoid large upfront costs associated with infrastructure purchase. <br>• Expand services into Asia. <br><br>Technical Requirements<br>• Assess key application for cloud suitability. <br>• Modify applications for the cloud. <br>• Move applications to a new infrastructure. <br>• Leverage managed services wherever feasible. <br>• Sunset 20% of capacity in existing data centers. <br>• Decrease latency in Asia.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="SetPage-term"><div class="SetPageTerm is-showing"><div class="SetPageTerm-inner"><div class="SetPageTerm-contentWrapper"><div class="SetPageTerm-content"><div class="SetPageTerm-side"><div class="SetPageTerm-sideContent"><div class="SetPageTerm-wordText"><span class="TermText notranslate lang-en">A lead engineer wrote a custom tool that deploys virtual machines in the legacy data center.

If you were working with a NAS instead of a SAN, it could map to either persistent disk or Cloud Storage as well. <br><br>Background Knowledge <br>Storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated, high-speed network that provides access to block-level storage. SANs were adopted to improve application availability and performance by segregating storage traffic from the rest of the LAN. <br><br>SAN and network-attached storage (NAS) are both network-based storage solutions. A SAN typically uses Fibre Channel connectivity, while NAS typically ties into to the network through a standard Ethernet connection. A SAN stores data at the block level, while NAS accesses data as files. To a client OS, a SAN typically appears as a disk and exists as its own separate network of storage devices, while NAS appears as a file server. <br><br>SAN is associated with structured workloads such as databases, while NAS is generally associated with unstructured data such as video and medical images.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="SetPage-term"><div class="SetPageTerm is-showing"><div class="SetPageTerm-inner"><div class="SetPageTerm-contentWrapper"><div class="SetPageTerm-content"><div class="SetPageTerm-side"><div class="SetPageTerm-sideContent"><div class="SetPageTerm-wordText"><span class="TermText notranslate lang-en">You have a managed instance group comprised of preemptible VM's.

After the backup is complete, use gsutil to move the backup to Google Cloud Storage. <br><br>This is similar scenario described as Multitiered backup recommended by Google. Disaster Recovery Cookbook<br>https://cloud.google.com/solutions/disaster-recovery-cookbook <br><br>Relational database backups often use a multitiered solution, where the live data is stored on a local storage device and backups are stored on progressively &quot;colder&quot; storage solutions. In this solution, a cron job (or similar) backs up the live data to the second tier at regular intervals, and another job is used to back up data from that tier to another tier at slightly wider intervals. <br><br>One possible implementation of this strategy on Google Cloud Platform would be to use persistent disk for the live data tier, a standard Cloud Storage bucket for the second tier, and a Cloud Storage Nearline bucket for the final tier. In this implementation, the tiers would be connected as follows: <br><br>1) Configure your application to back up data to the persistent disk attached to the instance. <br>2) Set up a task, such as a cron job, to move the data to the standard Cloud Storage bucket after a defined period of time. <br>3) Finally, set up another cron job or use Cloud Storage Transfer Service to move your data from the standard bucket to the Nearline bucket. <br><br>The following diagram illustrates this example implementation: <br><br>Answer C solution is to back up live data to fast local SSD instead of &quot;STANDARD STORAGE&quot; as first tier, then move the backup to Google cloud storage (storage class is not specified) other than &quot;NEARLINE&quot; as second tier. <br><br>D - Use gcsfuse to mount a Google Cloud Storage bucket as a volume directly on the instance and write backups to the mounted location using mysqldump Cloud Storage FUSE is only community-supported, it may or may not suitable for production workloads. <br><br>Cloud Storage FUSE is an open source FUSE adapter that allows you to mount Cloud Storage buckets as file systems on Linux or OS X systems.

See: Access control for Deployment Manager \n\nThe question statement is true but it's not a business risk, it's actually a good security feature. \n\nB - Cloud Deployment Manager APIs could be deprecated in the future. Yes, but you should expect every API eventual could be deprecated with replacement of new version. With the right programming model, migrate to different version can be properly handled. See: Deprecated APIs \n\nC (Correct answer) - Cloud Deployment Manager only supports automation of Google Cloud resources - The statement is true, and it is a business risk since it ties deployment automation to Deployment manager, for example, it could potentially hamper the perspective customers from switching or migrating to GCP from other cloud providers or from on-premise. \n\nD - Cloud Deployment Manager is unfamiliar to the company's engineers - this is normal IT issue not unique to Deployment Manager. Every engineer somehow at some points would encounter something new or unknown before and need to learn. \n\nE - Cloud Deployment Manager uses Python. Yes, a template is a file is written in either Python or Jinja2 and configuration file (the YAML file). But the Declarative nature allows the user to specify what the configuration should be and let the system figure out the steps to take. This make it less business risk. \n\nF (Correct answer) - Cloud Deployment Manager can be used to permanently delete cloud resources. Yes, the statement is true, and it is a protentional business risk if wrong or unintended deployment template used: e.g., if accidently delete critical resources and\/or bring the application down. \n\n\"When you delete a deployment, all resources that are part of the deployment are also deleted.\" \n\"Warning: You cannot undo this operation.\" See: Deleting Deployments","_definitionTtsUrl":null,"_definitionSlowTtsUrl":null,"_definitionAudioUrl":null,"_imageUrl":null,"setId":351828373,"rank":1,"lastModified":1544720005,"wordCustomAudioId":null,"definitionCustomAudioId":null,"definitionImageId":null},"12079298599":{"id":12079298599,"word":"Your developer group works on a set of VM's frequently throughout the day.

The least privilege principle for granting user role and permission still applies to service account. You should only grant the service account the minimum set of permissions required to achieve their goal. \n\nB (Correct answer) - Assign Compute Instance Admin role vs. Compute Admin \n\nThe Compute Engine Instance Admin role only gives access to create\/edit compute engine resources such as instances, disks, and snapshots while the Compute Engine Admin role also gives admin access to network resources as well, which is too much if your intended goal is to grant permission for managing compute engine instance only. \n\nC (Correct answer)- Separate production and test environments \n\nFor least privilege and separation of duties, the best practice is to separate both environments into different projects, development or production team gets their own accounts, and each team is assigned to only their projects. \n\nUse projects to group resources that share the same trust boundary. For example, resources for the same product or microservice can belong to the same project. \n\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/docs\/resource-hierarchy-access-control#best_practices \n\nD (Incorrect) - Create IAM Folders to manage groups of projects \n\nOrganizations can use folders to group projects under the organization node in a hierarchy.

If you were working with a NAS instead of a SAN, it could map to either persistent disk or Cloud Storage as well. \n\nBackground Knowledge \nStorage area network (SAN) is a dedicated, high-speed network that provides access to block-level storage. SANs were adopted to improve application availability and performance by segregating storage traffic from the rest of the LAN. \n\nSAN and network-attached storage (NAS) are both network-based storage solutions. A SAN typically uses Fibre Channel connectivity, while NAS typically ties into to the network through a standard Ethernet connection. A SAN stores data at the block level, while NAS accesses data as files. To a client OS, a SAN typically appears as a disk and exists as its own separate network of storage devices, while NAS appears as a file server. \n\nSAN is associated with structured workloads such as databases, while NAS is generally associated with unstructured data such as video and medical images.","_definitionTtsUrl":null,"_definitionSlowTtsUrl":null,"_definitionAudioUrl":null,"_imageUrl":null,"setId":351828373,"rank":30,"lastModified":1544722200,"wordCustomAudioId":null,"definitionCustomAudioId":null,"definitionImageId":null},"12080178935":{"id":12080178935,"word":"You have a managed instance group comprised of preemptible VM's.

In this solution, a cron job (or similar) backs up the live data to the second tier at regular intervals, and another job is used to back up data from that tier to another tier at slightly wider intervals. \n\nOne possible implementation of this strategy on Google Cloud Platform would be to use persistent disk for the live data tier, a standard Cloud Storage bucket for the second tier, and a Cloud Storage Nearline bucket for the final tier. In this implementation, the tiers would be connected as follows: \n\n1) Configure your application to back up data to the persistent disk attached to the instance. \n2) Set up a task, such as a cron job, to move the data to the standard Cloud Storage bucket after a defined period of time. \n3) Finally, set up another cron job or use Cloud Storage Transfer Service to move your data from the standard bucket to the Nearline bucket. \n\nThe following diagram illustrates this example implementation: \n\nAnswer C solution is to back up live data to fast local SSD instead of \"STANDARD STORAGE\" as first tier, then move the backup to Google cloud storage (storage class is not specified) other than \"NEARLINE\" as second tier. \n\nD - Use gcsfuse to mount a Google Cloud Storage bucket as a volume directly on the instance and write backups to the mounted location using mysqldump Cloud Storage FUSE is only community-supported, it may or may not suitable for production workloads. \n\nCloud Storage FUSE is an open source FUSE adapter that allows you to mount Cloud Storage buckets as file systems on Linux or OS X systems. It also provides a way for applications to upload and download Cloud Storage objects using standard file system semantics. https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/storage\/docs\/gcs-fuse \n\nThe mounted storage is treated as file system and it'll still incur IO cost. Furthermore, Cloud Storage FUSE has much higher latency than a local file system. https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/storage\/docs\/gcs-fuse#notes, which makes answer C as winner \n\nAdditional resources
