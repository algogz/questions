It does not have the scalability and elasticity to absorb this amount of data in real time. \n\nC) (Correct Answer) The reason is that data is in IoT nature and it will be used for analytics. \n\nBigtable: A scalable, fully-managed NoSQL wide-column database that is suitable for both real-time access and analytics workloads. Bigtable is ideal for very large NoSQL datasets and is useful for high-speed transactions and analysis. It integrates well with ML.

It's not suitable for IoT kind of spiky streaming data. Its buckets initially support roughly 1000 writes per second and then scale as needed. As the request rate for a given bucket grows, Cloud Storage automatically increases the IO capacity for that bucket by distributing the request load across multiple servers. Especially considering the click stream rate of 6,000 clicks per minute, with bursts of up to 8,500 clicks per second, the way GCS handle and absorb this kind high and low data stream by scale up and down make it not suitable for this task.","_definitionTtsUrl":null,"_definitionSlowTtsUrl":null,"_definitionAudioUrl":null,"_imageUrl":null,"setId":348640679,"rank":3,"lastModified":1544161746,"wordCustomAudioId":null,"definitionCustomAudioId":null,"definitionImageId":null},"11942754507":{"id":11942754507,"word":"Over time, you've created 5 snapshots of a single instance.

This lowers the total size of all your snapshots. \n3) The next snapshot no longer references the snapshot marked for deletion, and instead references the snapshot before it. \n\nBecause subsequent snapshots might require information stored in a previous snapshot, keep in mind that deleting a snapshot does not necessarily delete all the data on the snapshot. As mentioned in the first bullet above, if any data on a snapshot that is marked for deletion is needed for restoring subsequent snapshots, that data is moved into the next corresponding snapshot.

Answer D need to restart the instance for the script to take effect. \n\nTroubleshooting SSH\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/compute\/docs\/troubleshooting\/troubleshooting-ssh \n\nUnder certain conditions, it is possible that a Google Compute Engine instance no longer accepts SSH connections. There are many reasons this could happen, from a full disk to an accidental misconfiguration of sshd. This section describes a number of tips and approaches to troubleshoot and resolve common SSH issues. \n\n1) Check your firewall rules ... ... ...\n\n2) Debug the issue in the serial console\nYou can enable read-write access to an instance's serial console so you can log into the console and troubleshoot problems with the instance. This is particularly useful when you cannot log in with SSH or if the instance has no connection to the network. The serial console remains accessible in both these conditions. \n\n3) Test the network\nYou can use the netcat tool to connect to your instance on port 22 and see if the network connection is working. If you connect and see an ssh banner (e.g. SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.0p1 Debian-4), your network connection is working, and you can rule out firewall problems. First, use the gcloud tool to obtain the external natIP for your instance: \n\ngcloud compute instances describe example-instance --format='get(networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP)' 198.51.100.8 \n\nUse the nc command to connect to your instance: # Check for SSH banner user@local:~$ nc [EXTERNAL.IP] 22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.0p1 Debian-4\n\n4) Try a new user ... ... ...\n5) Use your disk on a new instance ... ... ...\n\n6) Inspect an instance without shutting it down\nYou might have an instance you can't connect to that continues to correctly serve production traffic. In this case, you might want to inspect the disk without interrupting the instance's ability to serve users. First, take a snapshot of the instance's boot disk, then create a new disk from that snapshot, create a temporary instance, and finally attach and mount the new persistent disk to your temporary instance to troubleshoot the disk. \n\n7) Use a startup script If none of the above helped, you can create a startup script to collect information right after the instance starts. Follow the instructions for running a startup script.","_definitionTtsUrl":null,"_definitionSlowTtsUrl":null,"_definitionAudioUrl":null,"_imageUrl":null,"setId":348640679,"rank":37,"lastModified":1544161746,"wordCustomAudioId":null,"definitionCustomAudioId":null,"definitionImageId":null},"11942754541":{"id":11942754541,"word":"You have a Kubernetes cluster with 1 node-pool.
